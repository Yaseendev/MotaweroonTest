Majed Abu Zahira, said, according to “Al Arabiya Net”: “One of the signs coinciding with the emergence of the Suhail star is the receding angle of the sun’s rays, and the day begins to gradually shorten and cool down significantly at the end of the night. The sun tends to the south after it was vertical at the beginning of the summer, so the Arabs were looking forward to the rise of this star. It is pleasant at night with the temperature remaining in the daytime hours, then (Al Jabha) and it extends for 13 days, and it is the first star of the autumn season and the night gets cold in it and the weather improves during the day, then (Al Zubrah) and it lasts for 13 days and in which it gets colder at night, then (Al Saraffa), which is the last of the stars Suhail, and it extends for a period of 13 days, and was called that for the departure of the heat when it rises. The star of Suhail is 313 light-years away from the globe, and it is the brightest star in the group of stars (Carina) at the southern base, and the second brightest star at night after Sirius. The Suhail star has no effect on weather conditions, neither from near nor from afar, like other stars, but this star is just a sign, and its appearance coincides with the beginning of the seasonal change and the transition towards the autumnal equinox."),

            "The Suhail star is considered one of the stars that Arabs and others are keen to follow, especially in the Arabian Peninsula, and has a special interest in his appearance since ancient times. In ancient Egypt, he was inferred to sail to the Pharos lighthouse, which was located in ancient times in the city of Alexandria, and some of those who lived in the desert called the star of Suhail the ship of the desert. The Arabs used to sing of the Suhail star and mention it in their poems, as Abu Al-Ala Al-Maari (363 AH - 449 AH), (973 -1057 AD):\n\n\"And (Suhail) is like the paradise of love in color *** and the heart of the lover is in flickering\"\\ As for the present, NASA has taken it as one of the means of determining space navigation, by locating the Suhail star, and then directing some ships and spacecraft to their farthest paths from the universe. It is considered the second largest luminous star that can be seen with the naked eye and has been found so far, as the first star is Sirius, the brightest star in the sky for us on Earth. It is not easy to see it north of 37 degrees latitude in the northern hemisphere, it is one of the stars of the southern half of the sky.
